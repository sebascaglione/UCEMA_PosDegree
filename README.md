This is the final work that I had to do to get my diploma in Data Science.

On this practice I had to act like if I was an employee of a News Magacine, and my task was to give the Management an idea to aquire more views on our site.

The project can be divide in three parts:
      - First part is the understanding of the DB.
      - Second part is the elaboration of a model of prediction.
      - Third part and this was a plus was the elaboration of a recommendation system, which based on the preference of the visitors he will give something interesting to read.
